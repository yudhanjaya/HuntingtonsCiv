# HuntingtonsCiv

In 1993, Samuel Huntington wrote an article titled "The Clash of Civilizations". In it, he expounded his theory that the world was basically divided into 9 civilizations - the Western, the Orthodox, the Islamic, and so on and so forth. He split these civilizations based not on economics but along racial and cultural lines, and explained that wars would happen where cultures clashed.

I ended up generating a CSV of this. I read Huntington's 1996 book on the subject and tagged 245 countries by civilization blocs. Where his definitions ignored nations, I used UN geographical regional classifications to figure out the closest allegiance.

The CSV file is in the same repo as this Readme. As of the latest update, this includes a country's alpha-3 ISO code, name as per the World Bank classification, and UN region and sub-region codes.
